NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FatPacker - pack your dependencies onto your script
    file

VERSION
    version 1.100841

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [FatPacker]
        script = bin/my_script

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin uses App::FatPacker to pack your dependencies onto your
    script file.

FUNCTIONS
  munge_file
    When processing the script file indicated by the "script" configuration
    parameter, it prepends its packed dependencies to the script.

    This process creates temporary files outside the build directory, but if
    there are no errors, they will be removed again.

  safe_remove_tree
    This is a wrapper around "remove_tree()" from "File::Path" that adds
    some error checks.

  safe_system
    This is a wrapper around "system()" that adds some error checks.
